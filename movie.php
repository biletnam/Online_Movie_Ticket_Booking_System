The group reaches the ruins of a Mayan temple, and are confronted by Mayan villagers with guns and bows. Mathias tries to explain their purpose, but the villagers do not understand Spanish or English.

The rope breaks and Mathias falls, becoming completely paralyzed. Amy and Jeff descend the temple steps hoping to reason with the Mayans, but to no success. In anger, Amy throws a clump of vines at them and hits a young boy, whom the Mayans promptly kill. They realize the Mayans are afraid of the vines, and won't let them go since they have touched them. Later, Stacy and Amy descend the shaft to help Mathias and to find the phone. Jeff and Eric rig a backboard and bring Mathias out of the shaft.";
